- **Global:**

- **Relational:**

    - Describe the relationships of a unit to the other units at the same level.
- **Analytical:**
    - Measured by referring to the subunits at a lower level.
    - Refer to the distribution of an absolute or global variable at a lower level.
    - Involves aggregation.
- **Structural:**
    - Measured by referring to the subunits at a lower level.
    - Refer to the distribution of relational variables at a lower level.
    - Involves aggregation.
- **Contextual:**
    - Refer to the superunits.
    - Involves _disaggregation_.
