# The 5 Components of a Good Introduction

(according to [John W. Creswell](https://www.amazon.ca/Research-Design-Qualitative-Quantitative-Approaches/dp/1452226105/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543002787&sr=8-2&keywords=creswell+research+design))

1. Establish the problem leading to the study.
2. Review the literature about the problem.
3. Identify deficiencies in the literature about the problem.
4. Target an audience and note the significance of the problem to that audience.
5. Identify the purpose of the proposed study.

## Purpose Statements

It sets the objectives, intent, or major idea of a proposal or a study.

- Qualitative
    - Contains information about the phenomenon explored.
    - Use _purpose_, _intent_, or _objective_ to signal to the reader that this is the central controlling idea.
    - Focus on a **single** phenomenon/concept/idea.
    - Use action verbs.
    - Use neutral words and phrases.
    - Provide a general working definition of the central phenomenon or idea.
    - Include words denoting the inquiry strategy.
    - Mention the study participants.
    - Identify research site.
    - Include scoping language.
    - Example:
    ```
    The purpose of this ... (strategy of inquiry) study is to ... (action verb) the ... (phenomenon) for ... (participants) at ... (site). At this stage in the research, the ... (phenomenon) will be generally defined as ... (general definition).
    ```
- Quantitative
    - Includes the variables in the study and their relationship, the participants, and the research site.
    - Use _purpose_, _intent_, or _objective_ to signal the major intent of the study.
    - Identify the theory, model, or conceptual framework.
    - Identify the independent and dependent variables.
    - Use words that connect the independent and dependent variables (e.g. _the relationship between_ or _a comparison of_)
    - Position the variables from left to right in the purpose statement with the independent variable(s) followed by the dependent variable.
    - Mention the specific type of strategy of inquiry.
    - Make reference to the participants (or unit of analysis).
    - Generally define each key variable.
    - Example:
    ```
    The purpose of this ... (strategy) study is to test the theory of ... that ... (compares/relates) the ... (independent variable) to ... (dependent variable), controlling for ... (control variables) for ... (participants) at ... (site). The independent variable(s) ... will be defined as ... (provide definition). The dependent variable(s) will be defined as ... (provide definition)., and the control and intervening variable(s), ... (identify control and intervening variables) will be defined as ... (provide definition).
    ```
- Mixed Methods
    - Contains the overall intent of the study, information about both the quantitative and qualitative strands of the study, and the rationale of incorporating both strands to study the research problem.
    - Use signaling words (_purpose_ or _intent_).
    - Indicate the overall intent of the study from a content perspective.
    - Indicate the type of mixed methods design (sequential, concurrent, or transformational).
    - Discuss the reasons for combining both quantitative and qualitative data.
        - To triangulate broad numeric trends from quantitative research and the detail of qualitative research.
        - To explore participant views with the intent of building on these views with quantitative research so that they can be explored with a large sample of the population (exploratory).
        - To obtain quantitative results from a sample and then follow up with a few individuals to help explain those results in more depth (explanatory).
        - To best convey the trends and voices of marginalized groups or individuals.
    - Include characteristics of a good qualitative purpose statement (see above).
    - Include characteristics of a good quantitative purpose statement (see above).
    - Consider adding information about the specific types of both qualitative and quantitative data collection.
