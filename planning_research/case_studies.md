# Case Studies

(according to [Robert K. Yin](https://www.amazon.ca/Case-Study-Research-Design-Methods/dp/0761925538/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543864818&sr=8-2&keywords=case+study+research+design+and+methods))

## Five Components of Case Study Design

1. The study's questions
2. The propositions (if any)
3. The unit(s) of analysis
4. The logic linking the data to the propositions
5. The criteria for interpreting the data

### The Study's Questions

Case studies are best suited for how/why questions.

### The Study's Propositions

If this is more of an exploratory study, then there might not be propositions.
If there are any, it means you are looking to understand how/why they occur.

### The Unit(s) of Analysis

Usually defined by the overarching research questions.
If no unit of analysis is clear, it means the RQs are too vague.
They can be changed later.

## Criteria for Judging the Quality of Research Designs

| Tests | Case Study Tactic | Research Phase Where Tactic Occurs |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Construct Validity** | - Use multiple sources of evidence <br /> - Establish chain of evidence <br /> - Have key informants review draft case study report | - Data collection <br /> - Data collection <br /> - Composition |
| **Internal Validity** | - Do pattern matching <br /> - Do explanation building <br /> - Address rival explanations <br /> - Use logic models | Data analysis |
| **External Validity** | - Use theory in single-case studies <br /> - Use replication logic in multiple-case studies | Research design |
| **Reliability** | - Use case study protocol <br /> - Develop case study database | Data collection |

## Case Study Design

### Single versus Multiple Case Study Designs

#### Rationales for single-case study designs

- Single cases can represent the _critical_ case in testing a well-formulated theory.
- A single case can also represent an _extreme_ or _unique_ case.
- Conversely, a single case can be the _representative_ or _typical_ case.
- The _revelatory_ case exists when an investigator has an opportunity to observe and analyze a phenomenon previously inaccessible to scientific investigation.
- The _longitudinal_ case studies the same case over different points in time.
- Could be a pilot for a multiple-case study.

#### Vulnerability of single-case study designs

- A case may turn out not to be the case it was thought to be at the outset.

#### Rationales for multiple-case study designs

- Evidence can be considered more compelling (more robust).

#### Vulnerability of multiple-case study designs

- Requires extensive resources and time.

#### Replication logic for multiple-case study designs

Replication-logic should be used for multiple-case studies, as opposed to sampling logic.
Each case must be selected so that it:
1. predicts similar results
2. predicts contrasting results but for predictable reasons

### Holistic versus Embedded Case Study Designs

If a case study involves more than one unit of analysis, the ensuing design is referred to as an _embedded case study_.
Conversely, if a case study focuses on the global nature of an organization or program, it is referred to as a _holistic case study_.

#### Strengths of holistic designs

- When no subunits can be identified
- When the underlying theory is holistic in nature

#### Weaknesses of holistic designs

- When the global nature allows the investigator to avoid examining phenomena in operational detail.
- The nature of the study may change over its course.

#### Weaknesses of embedded designs

- When the case study focuses on a single subunit of analysis, and fails to return to the larger unit of analysis.
