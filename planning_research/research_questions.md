# Formulating Research Questions

## Qualitative Research

### The Central Question

A broad question that asks for an exploration of the central phenomenon or concept in a study.
The intent is to explore the complex set of factors surrounding the central phenomenon and present the varied perspectives or meanings that participants hold.

### Research Question Guidelines

- Ask 1 or 2 central questions followed by no more than 5-7 subquestions.
- Relate the central question to the specific qualitative strategy of inquiry.
- Begin the research questions with the words _what_ or _how_ to convey an open and emerging design.
- Focus on a single phenomenon or concept.
- Use exploratory verbs that convey the language of emerging design (e.g., _discover_, _seek to understand_, _explore a process_, _describe the experiences_, _report the stories_).
- Use nondirectional verbs rather than directional ones.
- Expect the research questions to evolve and change during the study.
- Use open-ended questions.
- Specifiy the participants and the research site.

## Quantitative Research Questions and Hyptheses

Quantitative **research questions** inquire about the relationships between variables.
Quantitative **hypotheses** are predictions the researcher makes about the expected relationships between variables.

### Research Question Guidelines

- The use of variables in research questions or hyptheses is limited to three basic approaches:
    - Compare groups on an independent variable to see its impact on a dependent variable.
    - Relate one or more independent variables to one or more dependent variables.
    - Describe responses to the independent, mediating, or dependent variables.
- The most rigorous form of research follows from a test of a theory.
- The independent and dependent variables must be measured separately to reinforce cause-and-effect logic.
- To eliminate redundancy, write only research questions or hypotheses, not both.
- When using hypotheses:
    - **Null Hypotheses:** No significant difference exists between groups on a variable.
    - **Directional Hypotheses:** The investigator make a prediction about the expected outcome (based on prior literature and studies on the topic that suggest a potential outcome).
    - **Directional Hypotheses:** A prediction is made, but the exact form of differences is not specified because the researcher does not know what can be predicted from past literature.
- Unless the study intentionally employs demographic variables as predictors, use non-demographic variables as independent and dependent variables.
- Use the same pattern of word order in the questions or hypotheses to enable a reader to easily identify the major variables.

## Mixed Methods Research

The study should start with a mixed methods research question to shape the methods and overall design of a study.

- The questions or hypotheses can be advanced at the beginning or when they emerge during a later phase of the research.
- The mixed methods research question could either be written at the beginning or when it emerges.
- The different ways all types of research questions can be written in a mixed methods study:
    - Write separate quantitative questions or hypotheses and qualitative questions.
    - Write separate quantitative questions or hypotheses and qualitative questions and follow them with a mixed methods question.
    - Write only a mixed methods question that reflects the procedures or content, and do not include separate quantitative and qualitative questions.
