# Theories

[Creswell](https://www.amazon.ca/Research-Design-Qualitative-Quantitative-Methods/dp/1412965578/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=creswell+research+design&qid=1599734210&sr=8-6) mentions the following:

- Theories in _quantitative_ research are typically an _explanation_ of the answers to the questions researchers pose.
- Theories in _qualitative_ research vary. They could be the final outcome (grounded theory), or the lens that shapes research questions and design (ethnographies or advocacy research).
- Theories in _mixed methods_ research can be either generated from the study, or studies may be used to test them.

Generally speaking, theories offer an explanation for behaviors and phenomena.

This page will use Creswell's structure as a base, and augment it with both literature and my experience with theory development in software engineering research

## What constitutes a theory?

### In quantitative research

Theories are formed around variables.
There are, generally speaking, six types of variables when it comes to formulating theories in a quantitative setting:

| Variable Type | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Independent | Variables that _probably_ cause changes in other variables. |
| Dependent | Variables that are _probably_ changed by or _probably_ change with independent variables (correlation vs. causation). |
| Intervening/Mediating | Variables that influence the relationship between independent and dependent variables. |
| Moderating | Typically found in experiments, these are _derived_ variables created by the researcher to determine the joint impact of several variables. |
| Control | An independent variable that you as a researcher deem could have an influence on the dependent variable. |
| Confouding/Spurious | A variable that you, for whatever reason, cannot measure but assume has an impact on your study. You would typically mention this in a limitations section. |

Your predictions about how these variables behave forms **hypotheses**.
In this context, a construct (as operationalized by variables) and its assumed/proven relationship to other constructs (as predicted by hypotheses) forms a **theory**.

Theories exist on three levels based on their breadth of coverage:

| Theory Level | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Micro | Focuses on a small unit of analysis, such as a small slice of time, or people. |
| Macro | The unit of analysis is a larger aggregate, such as social institutions, cultural systems, or societies. |
| Meso | Links micro-level theories to macro-level theories (e.g., organizational level). |

In the context of quantitative studies, one typically starts with a theory, and attempts to verify/test it rather than develop it.
The theory then comes first, frames the entire study, and influences research questions and hypotheses when collecting data.
This is often referred to as the **deductive approach**.

### In qualitative research

Theories in the qualitative setting can be used in the following ways:

- To explain observed behavior and phenomena and test theory applicability across contexts.
- As a lens/perspective to frame a study's questions, propositions, and design.
- As the _end point_, to be built from scratch (inductively) from data. These are often referred to as propositional generalizations or pattern theories.
- Some studies may not employ an explicitly defined theory at all, but this is open to debate.

## How are theories represented?

Theories can be represented in three possible ways:

- A series of hypotheses
- A series of if-then logic statements
- Visual models
